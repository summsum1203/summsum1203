## What I'm building now
As a freelancer at SASSy.code Web Development I create accessible, on-brand websites for small businesses and advocacy groups — with a focus on SASS-based styling systems and component-driven UI. I’m also actively developing the Unleashing Truth advocacy site for pitbull awareness and shelter support.

---

## Advocacy & Community
I’m an advocate for pitbull awareness — I own two pitbulls and I’m building Unleashing Truth to help end the unjust stigma placed on these dogs through education, training, and shelter support. I welcome collaborators and contributors who care about animals and inclusive design.

## Fun Fact                                                                
I’m a HUGE Pitbull Advocate, Lover,and owner/pack-momma of two pit bulls and a wire-hair fox/pinscher mix. The unconditonal love from my doggy's is my reason to want to help put an end to their stigma! Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) is unfair and unjust! Laws that restrict or ban specific dog breeds (most commonly, pit bulls) based on appearance rather than behavior. I will continue educating others about the breed, promoting responsible ownership, & shelter adoptions (ending unnecessary euthanasia). Be a voice for the voiceless, I am continuously working on Unleashing Truth: Pitbull Advocacy website and hope to have it up and running soon. Check back with me to see if I have added a URL for Unleashing Truth! You will have the chance to buy pit bull apparel from the site. Thanks and God bless!
Summer
